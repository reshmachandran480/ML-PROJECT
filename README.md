# End to End Machine Learning Project
This repository contains code and resources for an end-to-end machine learning project.
## Overview
The project aims to analyze how various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch quality, and test preparation courses influence students' performance in exams. By understanding these relationships, educators and policymakers can make informed decisions to improve educational outcomes.

## Approach:

- **Understanding the Problem Statement:** Clearly define the objective of the project, which is to identify the factors affecting student performance.
- **Data Collection:** Utilize a dataset from Kaggle containing information on students' demographics, parental education levels, and exam scores.
- **Data Checks:** Perform data checks to ensure data quality, including checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore relationships between variables.
- **Data Pre-Processing:** Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to predict student performance based on the provided features. Experiment with various algorithms such as regression, classification, or ensemble methods.
- **Choose Best Model:** Evaluate the performance of different models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model for deployment.

  
By following this lifecycle of a machine learning project, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing student performance and provide valuable information for educational stakeholders to improve educational strategies and support systems.
